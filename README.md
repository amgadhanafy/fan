# Fan Test Problem Statement:

Using Core Java, Implement a simple ceiling fan with these characteristics:

* The unit has 2 pull cords:

    * One increases the speed each time it is pulled.  There are 3 speed settings, and an “off” (speed 0) setting. 

        * If the cord is pulled on speed 3, the fan returns to the “off” setting.

    * One reverses the direction of the fan at the current speed setting.

        * Once the direction has been reversed, it remains reversed as we cycle through the speed settings, until reversed again.

* You can assume the unit is always powered (no wall switch)
